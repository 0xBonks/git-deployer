I'm unable to directly analyze the repository you specify, as I do not have access to external repositories or URLs. However, you can provide me with details about the repository structure, programming languages, configuration files, or dependencies by copying and pasting the relevant files or information here, and I can help generate the deployment guide accordingly. 

For the most accurate and comprehensive results, you can share the following:

1. **List of files and folders** in the repository root
2. **Content of important configuration files** (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `.env`, `Dockerfile`, etc.)
3. **Environment-specific scripts** or directories related to deployment/configuration
4. Any details on **build tools or frameworks** the application relies on.

Once that information is available, I'll be able to create the Git repository deployment guide for you. Let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed!
