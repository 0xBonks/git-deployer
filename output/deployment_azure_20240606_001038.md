I'm unable to directly access external URLs, including Git repositories, as doing so would require the ability to browse the webâ€”functionality I currently do not possess. To help with the creation of a deployment guide, please provide me with the relevant details of the repository, such as:

- A brief description of the contents and structure of the repository
- Programming languages and frameworks used in the project
- The content of key configuration files like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, etc.
- Any deployment scripts or configuration files already in the repository (like Terraform files, Azure CLI scripts, etc.)

Once you provide me with this information, I can create a comprehensive Azure deployment guide based on your input.
