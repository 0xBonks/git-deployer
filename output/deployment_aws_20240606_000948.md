I'm unable to analyze external GitHub repositories directly, as I don't have access to internet resources. However, I can help you create a general template or provide guidance based on similar repositories I’ve analyzed in the past. You may manually provide the contents of key repository files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, deployment scripts, or README contents), and I’ll tailor deployment instructions and configurations accordingly. If you're ready to proceed, you can paste the relevant information here!
