I'm sorry, but I am unable to directly analyze and extract information from external Git repositories (such as `https://github.com/0xBonks/CryptoArena.git`) or access the internet. However, I can help you structure a detailed deployment guide for OpenShift based on the information you provide from the repository.

If you can share details such as:

- The repository structure (e.g., files and folders)
- Programming languages/frameworks used
- Content of dependency files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- Any existing deployment script or configuration
- Specific requirements or notes mentioned in the repository (like a README)

I can generate a comprehensive deployment guide for you. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
